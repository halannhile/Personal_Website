      <description>I am an Environmental Specialist employed with the NJ Department of Environmental Protection. I work with the Division of Water Monitoring &amp;amp; Standards, where we research key water quality issues throughout the state. I utilize different computer software such as R, ArcGIS, Python, etc. to analyze the vast amount of data we collect.
Solving key environmental issues and gaining actionable insight from data ignites a fire inside me. Being that a majority of my work involves making data driven decisions, I have gained extensive experience with data science techniques.</description>
