I have been told by a countless number of people that it is a great way to showcase your skills and tell your story. I have been meaning to make one for some time now but I kept coming up with excuses. The two biggest excuses I kept telling myself was that it would be too difficult \u0026amp; it would cost money. Boy was I wrong. It wasn’t until I started using R this past year that I realized how wrong I was. After a quick google search I came across the blogdown package. Blogdown is an amazing package in which you can create blogs and websites with R Markdown. Now I’m not saying that this stuff is extremely easy but if someone like myself(absolutely no website development knowledge) can do it, YOU CAN TOO! This blog post isn’t a sure fire way to do it but more of an overview of how I did it. I would also like to point out that this is a very basic introduction  to creating a blog/website with blogdown. The amount of things you can do with this package is almost endless.. especially if you have an understanding of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.\n\r\rPrerequisites:\rBefore you jump right in I recommend reading some online material and watching some youtube videos. Here is a list of the resources that helped me a lot.\n1.blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown\n2.Up and Running with Blogdown\n3.Making a Website with Blogdown\n4.Academic Theme Documentation (if your going to use the academic theme)\n5.Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages\nOnce you review the above material you should have a pretty firm grasp on how to get the ball rolling. One of the biggest hurdles I had was creating my site with the Hugo Academic Theme. It wasn’t until I found this post on stackoverflow that I was able to figure out what the problem was. There was a breaking change in the hugo-academic theme, so I had to download the development verison of blogdown. Not sure if this is still a thing but if you have the same problem definitly check out that post! The last piece of advice I will give before we get started is to make sure you check what the minimum hugo verision is for the theme you want to use. You can do this by going to the hugo website. Pick the theme you want to use and look at the line that says Minimum Hugo Verision: Here’s an example \r","date":1550016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550016000,"objectID":"68929e8b07e67b0d57cddb472b71e050","permalink":"/post/creating-a-website-with-the-academic-theme-in-blogdown/","publishdate":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/creating-a-website-with-the-academic-theme-in-blogdown/","section":"post","summary":"My thoughts and some guidance on how to set up a free website with blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify","tags":["blogdown","R"],"title":"Creating a website with the academic theme in blogdown","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Forecasting the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the continental United States (CONUS) is a problematic process for most global forecast systems. A majority tends to have a strong bias and they don’t provide a skilled prediction of the intensity, coverage and frequency of the diurnal cycle. Accurately forecasting the diurnal precipitation cycle, is closely related to the overall quality of the global forecast itself. Also, the accuracy of representation of physical processes in the models is indicative to the forecast skill. Major implementations have been made for the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational Global Forecast System (GFS) throughout the years to make improvements to the diurnal cycle of precipitation. This study examines the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the CONUS during the winter and summer months of 2016-2017. The operational and experimental GFS will be analyzed and compared to the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation. To accomplish this, 3-hourly averaged accumulated precipitation vs. forecast hour plots, for the different models, were created. This allowed us to gain insight on how the skill of the models were performing, against the observations.\nThis study is expected to provide feedback to the model developers at NCEP’s Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) to inform (for making further) priorities for improvements to the GFS model, especially with the newly selected Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) Finite Volume Cube Sphere (FV3) modeling system. The NGGPS is a fully coupled system that will be designed to create useful forecast guidance out to 30 days, extend forecast skill beyond 8 to 10 days, and improve hurricane track/intensity forecast.\n","date":1549857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549857600,"objectID":"c1fb692d6fa69e3357755f7490c034c5","permalink":"/project/ncep_project/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/ncep_project/","section":"project","summary":"My summer research project from my internship at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction","tags":["Meteorology"],"title":"Analyzing the Diurnal Cycle of Precipitation in the NCEP Global Forecast System","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Easterly waves are weak troughs of low pressure that propagate westward across the Atlantic and East Pacific. These disturbances seed the majority of East Pacific and Atlantic tropical cyclones. Most easterly waves originate from Africa, although recent work indicates that they can also be locally generated in the East Pacific. This study analyzed the development and origins of the two precursor disturbances that eventually became Hurricanes Patricia and John in the East Pacific. Using TRMM precipitation and ERA-I reanalysis datasets, we investigate the local processes responsible for the organization of vorticity and precipitation in the initial disturbances from which these tropical cyclones formed. It is shown that although the easterly wave that formed Hurricane John originated from Africa, interactions with the Gulf of Papagayo jet influenced the intensification of the disturbance. The disturbance that formed Hurricane Patricia strengthened through complex interactions with the Gulf of Tehuantepec wind jet. Our results support the contention that both local and remote influences contribute to easterly wave formation in the East Pacific Ocean.\n","date":1549857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549857600,"objectID":"8d957c55f0b1df929e4349f005683012","permalink":"/project/colorado_state_project/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/colorado_state_project/","section":"project","summary":"My summer undergraduate research internship at Colorado State University in the Department of Atmospheric Science.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database.

The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location.
