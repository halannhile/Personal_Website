A majority tends to have a strong bias and they don’t provide a skilled prediction of the intensity, coverage and frequency of the diurnal cycle. Accurately forecasting the diurnal precipitation cycle, is closely related to the overall quality of the global forecast itself. Also, the accuracy of representation of physical processes in the models is indicative to the forecast skill. Major implementations have been made for the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational Global Forecast System (GFS) throughout the years to make improvements to the diurnal cycle of precipitation. This study examines the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the CONUS during the winter and summer months of 2016-2017. The operational and experimental GFS will be analyzed and compared to the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation. To accomplish this, 3-hourly averaged accumulated precipitation vs. forecast hour plots, for the different models, were created. This allowed us to gain insight on how the skill of the models were performing, against the observations.\nThis study is expected to provide feedback to the model developers at NCEP’s Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) to inform (for making further) priorities for improvements to the GFS model, especially with the newly selected Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) Finite Volume Cube Sphere (FV3) modeling system. The NGGPS is a fully coupled system that will be designed to create useful forecast guidance out to 30 days, extend forecast skill beyond 8 to 10 days, and improve hurricane track/intensity forecast.\n","date":1549857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549857600,"objectID":"c1fb692d6fa69e3357755f7490c034c5","permalink":"/project/ncep_project/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/ncep_project/","section":"project","summary":"My summer research project from my internship at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction","tags":["Meteorology"],"title":"Analyzing the Diurnal Cycle of Precipitation in the NCEP Global Forecast System","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Easterly waves are weak troughs of low pressure that propagate westward across the Atlantic and East Pacific. These disturbances seed the majority of East Pacific and Atlantic tropical cyclones. Most easterly waves originate from Africa, although recent work indicates that they can also be locally generated in the East Pacific. This study analyzed the development and origins of the two precursor disturbances that eventually became Hurricanes Patricia and John in the East Pacific. Using TRMM precipitation and ERA-I reanalysis datasets, we investigate the local processes responsible for the organization of vorticity and precipitation in the initial disturbances from which these tropical cyclones formed. It is shown that although the easterly wave that formed Hurricane John originated from Africa, interactions with the Gulf of Papagayo jet influenced the intensification of the disturbance. The disturbance that formed Hurricane Patricia strengthened through complex interactions with the Gulf of Tehuantepec wind jet. Our results support the contention that both local and remote influences contribute to easterly wave formation in the East Pacific Ocean.\n","date":1549857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549857600,"objectID":"8d957c55f0b1df929e4349f005683012","permalink":"/project/colorado_state_project/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/colorado_state_project/","section":"project","summary":"My summer undergraduate research internship at Colorado State University in the Department of Atmospheric Science.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
