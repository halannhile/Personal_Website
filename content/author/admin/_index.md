I am an Environmental Specialist employed with the <a href = "https://www.nj.gov/dep/" target = "_blank">NJ Department of Environmental Protection</a>. I work with the <a href= "https://www.state.nj.us/dep/wms/" target = "_blank"> Division of Water Monitoring & Standards</a>, where we research key water quality issues throughout the state. I utilize different computer software such as R, ArcGIS, Python, etc. to analyze the vast amount of data we collect.

Solving key environmental issues and gaining actionable insight from data ignites a fire inside me. Being that a majority of my work involves making data driven decisions, I have gained extensive experience with data science techniques. I look forward everyday to contribute my skills and knowledge in an environment that will make a difference.

When I am not crunching data or creating solutions for a better environment I can be found shredding the gnar at your local skatepark or ski resort. I love meeting new people and learning about new opportunities, so please feel free to reach out to me.
