<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Maps are apart of our everyday lifes. They can be seen in almost every industry and are useful for numerous different purposes. A lot of the time these maps are static. Sometimes, however, it’s extremely useful to interact with the data on the map. This is where the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> package comes in. This post will go over what the <code>Leaflet</code> package is and provide some useful tips on how to make your new interactive map shine.</p>

<h3>What is <code>Leaflet</code> ?</h3>
<p><code>Leaflet</code> is an open-source <code>JavaScript</code> library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It’s used by a great deal of websites and GIS specialists all over the world! The great thing about <code>Leaflet</code> is that it’s super easy to learn and there’s so many tutorials out there to help you. Luckily, instead of having to learn <code>JavaScript</code> theres’s an R <code>Leaflet</code> package. This R package makes it extremely easy to integrate and control <code>Leaflet</code> maps in R.</p>
