### Overview 

Maps are apart of our everyday lifes. They can be seen in almost every industry and are useful for numerous different purposes. A lot of the time these maps are static. Sometimes, however, it's extremely useful to interact with the data on the map. This is where the [Leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf){target="_blank"} package comes in. This post will go over what the ```Leaflet``` package is and provide some useful tips on how to make your new interactive map shine. 

### What is ```Leaflet``` ?
```Leaflet``` is an open-source ```JavaScript``` library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It's used by a great deal of websites and GIS specialists all over the world! The great thing about ```Leaflet``` is that it's super easy to learn and there's so many tutorials out there to help you. Luckily, instead of having to learn ```JavaScript``` theres's an R ```Leaflet``` package. This R package makes it extremely easy to integrate and control ```Leaflet``` maps in R.

### Prerequisites:

Before we jump head first into some of tips, I believe it's necessary for you to go over some material on the ```Leaflet``` package in R. This post assumes you know the basics of ```Leaflet``` but just in case someone got here and has no clue what I am talking about here are some resources I found helpful when I first started using the package.

### Tip #1: Use the ```leaflet.extras``` package to add extra functionality to your map

The [```leaflet.extras```](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras) package is a great tool to add some cool features to your map using various [Leaflet plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins) (**Note: Not all the plugins are integrated**). I wont go over all the various plugins,instead, I will show you the functions I use and find most useful.

#### Reset map's view to original view

Resetting your map's view to it's original view is very simple. It can be done with one function: ```addResetMapButton```

```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 7))%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addResetMapButton()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Load in necessary packages ###
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

### Create leaflet map ###
leaflet()%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addResetMapButton()

```


#### Adding GPS location (**Note: Open the map in a browser not inside Rstudio! Allow the request for location access**)
```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

map <- addControlGPS(map, options = gpsOptions(position = "topleft", activate = TRUE, 
                                               autoCenter = TRUE, maxZoom = 10, 
                                               setView = TRUE))
activateGPS(map)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

map <- addControlGPS(map, options = gpsOptions(position = "topleft", activate = TRUE, 
                                               autoCenter = TRUE, maxZoom = 10, 
                                               setView = TRUE))
activateGPS(map)

```

#### Draw features on Leaflet map and have ability to style
```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 8)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addDrawToolbar(
    targetGroup='draw',
    editOptions = editToolbarOptions(selectedPathOptions = selectedPathOptions()))  %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c('draw'), options =
                     layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE)) %>%
  addStyleEditor()
```
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 8)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addDrawToolbar(
    targetGroup='draw',
    editOptions = editToolbarOptions(selectedPathOptions = selectedPathOptions()))  %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c('draw'), options =
                     layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE)) %>%
  addStyleEditor()


```


{{% alert note %}}
A very interesting post on using the ```addDrawToolbar() ``` function to select multiple locations on your leaflet map in shiny can be seen here [Selecting Multiple Locations on a Leaflet Map in R Shiny](https://redoakstrategic.com/geoshaper/){target="_blank"}. Check it out!

### Tip #2: Have map zoom into polygon once polygon is clicked in shiny
