### Overview 

Maps are apart of our everyday lifes. They can be seen in almost every industry and are useful for numerous different purposes. A lot of the time these maps are static. Sometimes, however, it's extremely useful to interact with the data on the map. This is where the [Leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf){target="_blank"} package comes in. This post will go over what the ```Leaflet``` package is and provide some useful tips on how to make your new interactive map shine. 

### What is ```Leaflet``` ?
```Leaflet``` is an open-source ```JavaScript``` library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It's used by a great deal of websites and GIS specialists all over the world! The great thing about ```Leaflet``` is that it's super easy to learn and there's so many tutorials out there to help you. Luckily, instead of having to learn ```JavaScript``` theres's an R ```Leaflet``` package. This R package makes it extremely easy to integrate and control ```Leaflet``` maps in R.

### Prerequisites:

Before we jump head first into some of tips, I believe it's necessary for you to go over some material on the ```Leaflet``` package in R. This post assumes you know the basics of ```Leaflet``` but just in case someone got here and has no clue what I am talking about here are some resources I found helpful when I first started using the package.
