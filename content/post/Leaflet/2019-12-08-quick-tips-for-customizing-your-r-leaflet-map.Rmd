### Overview 

Maps are apart of our everyday lives. They can be seen in almost every industry and are useful for numerous different purposes. A lot of the time these maps are static. Sometimes, however, it's extremely useful to interact with the data on the map. This is where the [Leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf){target="_blank"} package comes in. This post will go over what the ```Leaflet``` package is and provide some useful tips on how to make your new interactive map shine. 

### What is ```Leaflet``` ?
```Leaflet``` is an open-source ```JavaScript``` library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It's used by a great deal of websites and GIS specialists all over the world! The great thing about ```Leaflet``` is that it's super easy to learn and there's so many tutorials out there to help you. Luckily, instead of having to learn ```JavaScript``` theres's an R ```Leaflet``` package. This R package makes it extremely easy to integrate and control ```Leaflet``` maps in R.

### Prerequisites:

Before we jump headfirst into some of the tips, I believe you must go over over some material on the ```Leaflet``` package in R. This post assumes you know the basics of ```Leaflet``` but just in case someone got here and has no clue what I am talking about here are some resources I found helpful when I first started using the package.

### Tip #1: Use the ```leaflet.extras``` package to add extra functionality to your map

The [```leaflet.extras```](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras) package is a great tool to add some cool features to your map using various [Leaflet plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins) (**Note: Not all the plugins are integrated**). I won't go over all the various plugins, instead, I will show you the functions I use and find most useful.

#### Reset map's view to original view

Resetting your map's view to it's original view is very simple. It can be done with one function: ```addResetMapButton```

```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 7))%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addResetMapButton()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Load in necessary packages ###
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

### Create leaflet map ###
leaflet()%>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addResetMapButton()

```


#### Adding GPS location (**Note: Open the map in a browser not inside Rstudio! Allow the request for location access**)
```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

map <- addControlGPS(map, options = gpsOptions(position = "topleft", activate = TRUE, 
                                               autoCenter = TRUE, maxZoom = 10, 
                                               setView = TRUE))
activateGPS(map)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

map <- addControlGPS(map, options = gpsOptions(position = "topleft", activate = TRUE, 
                                               autoCenter = TRUE, maxZoom = 10, 
                                               setView = TRUE))
activateGPS(map)

```

#### Draw features on Leaflet map and have ability to style
```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 8)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addDrawToolbar(
    targetGroup='draw',
    editOptions = editToolbarOptions(selectedPathOptions = selectedPathOptions()))  %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c('draw'), options =
                     layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE)) %>%
  addStyleEditor()
```
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 7)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addDrawToolbar(
    targetGroup='draw',
    editOptions = editToolbarOptions(selectedPathOptions = selectedPathOptions()))  %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c('draw'), options =
                     layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE)) %>%
  addStyleEditor()


```


{{% alert note %}}
A very interesting post on using the ```addDrawToolbar() ``` function to select multiple locations on your ```leaflet``` map in ```shiny``` can be seen here [Selecting Multiple Locations on a Leaflet Map in R Shiny](https://redoakstrategic.com/geoshaper/){target="_blank"}. Check it out!

### Tip #2: Have map zoom into polygon once polygon is clicked in shiny

Adding polygons to a ```leaflet``` map is a very common thing to do in ```leaflet```. This can be achieved by using the ```addPolygons()``` function. By giving the user the ability to zoom into the polygon, once a polygon is clicked, it makes it a lot easier to focus in on a particular area of the map. However, before we can use the ```addPolygons()``` function we first need to read in a polygon into R! There are many different ways to read in polygons into R but I find the ```sf``` package to be the best. To learn more about the ```sf``` package you can go [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) for an overview. Here is a minimal example of reading in a polygon into R and adding it to a ```leaflet``` map.

```
library(leaflet)
library(sf)

wma<-st_read(dsn="/Users/kevinzolea/Desktop/Personal_Website/content/post/Leaflet/",layer = "WMAs")

wma<-st_transform(wma,crs="+init=epsg:4326")

wma<-st_zm(wma,drop = T, what = "ZM")


leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 7)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data=wma)
  
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message= FALSE,warning= FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(sf)

wma<-st_read(dsn="/Users/kevinzolea/Desktop/Personal_Website/content/post/Leaflet/",layer = "WMAs")

wma<-st_transform(wma,crs="+init=epsg:4326")

wma<-st_zm(wma,drop = T, what = "ZM")


leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 7)%>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data=wma)
  
```

Since you don't have the shapefile I used to create the above map, you won't get the map by running the code. If you change the arguments in the function for your specific dataset you should get a map with polygons. You have to use ```st_transform``` to transform the projection to work with ```leaflet```. Now that you have the polygon loaded into R and working with ```leaflet```.. you can now bring ```shiny``` into the picture. To have the map zoom into a polygon once the polygon is clicked in shiny is actually quite simple. It only requires a few more lines of code. Here is a simple example, adding onto the example we used above. 

```
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(sf)
library(shiny)

wma<-st_read(dsn="/Users/kevinzolea/Desktop/Personal_Website/content/post/Leaflet/",layer = "WMAs")

wma<-st_transform(wma,crs="+init=epsg:4326")

wma<-st_zm(wma,drop = T, what = "ZM")

ui <- fluidPage(
    leafletOutput("mymap"))

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$mymap<-renderLeaflet({
    leaflet()%>%
      setView(lng = -74.4 ,lat =40, zoom = 7)%>%
      addTiles()%>%
      addPolygons(data=wma,fillColor = "green")
    
  })
  
  observe({
    click <- input$mymap_shape_click
    if(is.null(click))
      return()
    else
      leafletProxy("mymap")%>%
      setView(lng = click$lng , lat = click$lat, zoom=10)
  })
  
  
}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)


```

#### Wrapping Up

So as you can see, the ```leaflet``` package is a great tool to make some awesome interactive maps in R. While I gave you a couple tips to make your map have some flavor, the possibilites are endless to add some cool features to your map. As the author Napolean Hill once said, (**"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."**)
