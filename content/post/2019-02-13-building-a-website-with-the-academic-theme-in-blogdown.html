<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>For years now I have been contemplating developing my first personal website. I have been told by a countless number of people that it is a great way to showcase your skills and tell your story. I have been meaning to make one for some time now but I kept coming up with excuses. The two biggest excuses I kept telling myself was that it would be too difficult &amp; it would cost money. Boy was I wrong. It wasn’t until I started using R this past year that I realized how wrong I was. After a quick google search I came across the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/blogdown.pdf">blogdown</a> package. Blogdown is an amazing package in which you can create blogs and websites with <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>. Now I’m not saying that this stuff is extremely easy but if someone like myself(absolutely no website development knowledge) can do it, <strong>YOU CAN TOO!</strong> This blog post isn’t a sure fire way to do it but more of an overview of how I did it. I would also like to point out that this is a <strong>very basic introduction </strong> to creating a blog/website with blogdown. The amount of things you can do with this package is almost endless.. especially if you have an understanding of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.</p>
