<p>For years now I have been contemplating developing my first personal website. I have been told by a countless number of people that it is a great way to showcase your skills and tell your story. I have been meaning to make one for some time now but I kept coming up with excuses. The two biggest excuses I kept telling myself was that it would be too difficult &amp; it would cost money. Boy was I wrong. It wasnâ€™t until I started using R this past year that I realized how wrong I was.</p>
