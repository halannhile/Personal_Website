<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>For years now I have been contemplating developing my first personal website. I have been told by a countless number of people that it is a great way to showcase your skills and tell your story. I have been meaning to make one for some time now but I kept coming up with excuses. The two biggest excuses I kept telling myself was that it would be too difficult &amp; it would cost money. Boy was I wrong. It wasn’t until I started using R this past year that I realized how wrong I was. After a quick google search I came across the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/blogdown.pdf">blogdown</a> package. Blogdown is an amazing package in which you can create blogs and websites with <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>. Now I’m not saying that this stuff is extremely easy but if someone like myself(absolutely no website development knowledge) can do it, <strong>YOU CAN TOO!</strong> This blog post isn’t a sure fire way to do it but more of an overview of how I did it. I would also like to point out that this is a <strong>very basic introduction </strong> to creating a blog/website with blogdown. The amount of things you can do with this package is almost endless.. especially if you have an understanding of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<p>Before you jump right in I recommend reading some online material and watching some youtube videos. Here is a list of the resources that helped me a lot.</p>
<p>1.<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" target="_blank">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a></p>
<p>2.<a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/" target="_blank">Up and Running with Blogdown</a></p>
<p>3.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck&amp;t=649s" target="_blank">Making a Website with Blogdown</a></p>
<p>4.<a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/">Academic Theme Documentation</a> (if your going to use the academic theme)</p>
<p>5.<a href="https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/" target="_blank">Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages</a></p>
<p>Once you review the above material you should have a pretty firm grasp on how to get the ball rolling. One of the biggest hurdles I had was creating my site with the Hugo Academic Theme. It wasn’t until I found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54300535/unable-to-create-new-site-using-hugo-academic-theme">post</a> on stackoverflow that I was able to figure out what the problem was. There was a breaking change in the hugo-academic theme, so I had to download the development verison of blogdown. Not sure if this is still a thing but if you have the same problem definitly check out that post! The last piece of advice I will give before we get started is to make sure you check what the minimum hugo verision is for the theme you want to use. You can do this by going to the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">hugo website</a>. Pick the theme you want to use and look at the line that says <code>Minimum Hugo Verision:</code> You can check what verision of hugo you have by using <code>hugo_verison()</code> in R. Now lets get started!</p>

<div id="step-1-create-new-repository-in-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1: Create New Repository in GitHub</h2>
<p>I am going to assume you have used <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> before but if you haven’t that is completely fine. You can check out this <a href="https://guides.github.com/">site</a> to get a better understanding. Once you have a good understanding of GitHub and have an account created you need to create a new repository. You can name this repository anything you want but it’s usually best practice to give it a meaningful name.</p>
